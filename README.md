# PokemonMoveSelector
Allows for pokemon moves to be deciphered from an emulator, and touch inputs sent to the emulator through a twitch chat.

## Setup
- The authentication callback will host a local site on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/), in case you are hosting something already on that port.  
This shouldn't be a problem if you authenticate right away without hitting cancel.
